5 topics in STEM that sound interesting to me
- CRISPR gene editing and off-target mutation prediction
- Personalized gene therapy optimization
- Protein structure prediction and stability analysis
- Simulation of genetic drift and population evolution
- Drug-resistance mutations in cancer cell lines


3 Sources
CRISPR off target predictions - Found a model trained on experimental datasets to predict where unintended DNA cuts occur when CRISPR-Cas9 is used.
Protien structure prediction - Found a database that provides predicted protein structures. Could use python to analyse protein scores and visualize structure
Genetic Drift Simulation - Found a model called Popgen that can model how allele frequency changes in populations. It can model how beneficial or harmful CRISPR edits might spread through a population or cell line over generations.


Topic of Choice: CRISPR off-target prediction
- python script takes a short RNA sequence and compares it to larger DNA sequence
- Looks for potential binding sites (Under 3 mismatches)

Small version - Python script that takes a guide RNA sequence and scans a DNA file to find spots where the sequences almost match. It would count possible off-target sites with only a few mismatches using simple loops, conditionals, and lists.
Ambitious version - Python program that predicts CRISPR off-target activity across a genome using mismatch position, PAM sequence, and GC content. It would rank potential off-targets and visualize the results in graphs or genome-wide heatmaps.
